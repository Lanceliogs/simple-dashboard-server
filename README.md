# simple-dashboard-server
Some Python script that creates a TCP socket and allows to start child processes from the outside. Used to automate things.

I tried to make that only using packages which are available with base Python.
Was only tested with Python 3.9.10, don't blame me if this does not work with something else.
Anyway, it's fairly basic, so you can just modify whatever part you need to achieve your goals.
